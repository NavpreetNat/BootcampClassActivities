# Week 1, Class 3, Activity 1

**Who am I, and what is my background?**

My name's Navpreet, but you can call me Nav! I'm 25 and have spent the last 5 of my years pursuing a career in real estate sales, finally reaching the Sydney CBD market in 2019. As of May of this year (2022), I realised that I was chasing the wrong path and decided to redirect towards career aspects that're more inline with my true calling.

**What are my career goals?**

My ultimate goal is to establish a space company that develops its own space-craft, to then eventually enter the space of asteroid mining. This will take a lot of work and time, and so my interim plans are to enter the field of quantitative finance as a trader while completing a degree in aerospace engineering part-time.

**Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?**

The field is clearly growing rapidly, and there are therefore massive opportunities available for disruption of the existing financial marketplace. Finance, especially the quantitative space, also seems to be a much more worth-while skill for me to learn.
